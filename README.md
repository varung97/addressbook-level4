# Task Manager

<img src="docs/images/Ui.png" width="600"><br>

* This is a desktop Task Manager application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using 
  a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* This revolutionary application allows you full control over the day ahead without your fingers ever leaving the keyboard!
* Add, modify, search, tick off and get reminded about upcoming tasks, all without touching the mouse.
